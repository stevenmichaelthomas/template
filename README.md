To start running the project, open iterm and enter the following (once you enter
each item, press the return key):
* `cd projects/template` (this navigates to the project's directory)
* `bundle exec middleman server` (this starts the middleman server)

Then visit `http://localhost:4567` in your browser.

Open the sublime text project on your desktop, and start developing!

If you want to push your changes up to github, enter the following in iTerm:
* `git add -A` (this prepares any of your changes to be 'commited' to git)
* `git commit -m 'Enter a short description of the changes you've made'` (this
  adds the files to git on your computer)
* `git push` (this pushes the changes you've made from your computer, to
  github.com)
